\chapter{Acknowledgement}

All praise to God --- the Creator, the Nourisher, the Cherisher, the Sustainer and the Provider.

Before I could even started with my thesis work itself, I required helps and supports of others. As no one one can stand alone on his own, as he continually requires the help and support of others, it is important to thank them and appreciate their gratefulness. In my opinion, the thanks we give to others don't equates to the help, support and encouragement they have given. But what I do believe is our thanks will encourage them to continue their help to others without a period.

By saying that, I would like to thank foremost my professor as well as my supervisor, Prof. Dr. Elmar Cochlovius for an interesting thesis topic. Without his help and supervising, this thesis wouldn't have been possible. His continual support and feedback have helped this work to take its course and shape in the last six months. And my second supervisor, Miss Judith Jakob, for her support and encouragement through out this thesis work.

Next, I would like to thank my friends and acquaintances and housemates - Suprita, Bhargav, Preethi, Noor, Darshan, Siva, Subbu, Sachin, Mati, Alex, Deshi, Max, Mothanna, Omar, and Muhammad. They have helped and encouraged me in so many ways and for so many days. I owe them all a lot which I cannot repay. 

Lastly, I want to thank my parents and siblings. For their patience and understanding in letting me pursue my dream.
